        "##Introduction\n",
        "The Game of Life, originaly developed by John Conway is a simple zero player game, which means that the evolution of the game depends only on its initial sate. It is said to be Turing complete. It can thus in theory perform any computational task given enough time. In the game, there are cells which are either alive or dead. To determine if a cell remains alive or dies, it \"interacts\" with the cells around it. There is a set of rules which governs whether a cell should live or die at each time step, which can create patterns. Some of these patterns disappear very quickly, others may go on forever. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since there is no way to predict if inital arrangments of alive and dead squares will result in infinitely living shapes, in this report I will compare the survivability of the original game that is in a grid pattern to the game in a hexagonal pattern. More precisely, I will examine the effect of varying the inital density for the two different models.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Rules in the Game of Life With a Grid Setup\n",
        "The rules we used are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Any cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors survives\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Any dead cell with 3 alive neighbors becomes alive\n",
        "\n",
        "3. All other live cells die in the next generation and all other dead cells stay dead.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Difference in With a Hexagonal Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "- For the first rule, the condition is changed from needing 2-3 alive cells to stay alive to strictly 2 alive cells to stay alive.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that diagonals do count as adjacent. For the first project, we used a 10X10 matrix that loops around on itself. For this project, I will use fixed borders, but will increase the matrix to 100X100. For the first project, the simulation was already struggling with a 10X10 grid, so I indend to also make the code more efficient. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this report, I will examine the effect of the grid layout on the survivability of a random pattern. To do this, I will run 1000 simulations for each different initial density of living cells between 1 and 100 (in percentage of alive cells divided by all cells). Similarly to the first project, I will limit the number of generations to 400, patterns that live for more than 400 generations will be considered infinite. This is partially done to reduce the computational task."
